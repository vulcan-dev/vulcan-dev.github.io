                    <p>A multiplayer mod for <a href="https://www.beamng.com/game/" target="_blank">BeamNG</a>. I started this a few months back and have not had time to continue it.
                    So far, I've created the client and the dedicated server. I've went a different route from BeamMP, the new version of theirs will be
                    using a RPC, whereas mine will simply just bypass some game protections so I can just use Lua to communicate with the server. There
                    will be issues with my approach but hopefully I can solve those. If not, I have some other methods I would like to try.

                        I've done a bit but I've been focusing on other projects recently. After I finish up my other projects, I will be continue helping out with this.

                    <p>A another multiplayer mod for <a href="https://www.beamng.com/game/">BeamNG</a>. It's very similar to BeamMP but it's a bit more simple.
                    I've always used KissMP over BeamMP, I've contributed a lot and I've spent countless hours making addons for it.

                    I was invited to help with the development of this project (after Teardown), my main role is to create a dedicated server but I also help with the client.

                    <p>Back in 2021, TDMP was the only multiplayer mod. Soon after, Teardown released an update which broke many offsets and signatures that the mod uses
                    to communicate with the game. <br><br>Not long after, <a href="https://github.com/44lr" target="_blank">@Nahu</a> created a C# mod loader for Teardown called <a href="https://github.com/44lr/sledge" target="_blank">Sledge</a>.
                    After release, I heard someone called <a href="https://github.com/alexandargyurov" target="_blank">@alexandargyurov</a> was working on a multiplayer mod for Teardown.
                    I was very excited to see this and I decided to help him out. After a few weeks, we got a playable version. We had a dedicated server and we could connect, run around and drive vehicles.
                    <br><br>A few months later, Teardown once again released an update which broke the mod. After a while of trying to fix it, we all lost interest and decided to stop working on it.
                    <br><br>After a long time, I decided to pick it up again and after speaking to <a href="https://github.com/DangerKiddy/">@DangerKiddy</a>, he said he's been working on TDMP again so that's when I decided to work on that instead.
